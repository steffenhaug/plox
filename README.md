# gpu-accelerated plotting.
(plox = plot + oxidize or some shit)


## notes on text rendering
there are essentially two options:
- rasterizing text to a texture, and drawing it on a quad
    - probably easy to do at load time with external lib
    - will be less flexible, no dynamic text probably
- 1 glyph = 1 quad with (bezier?) curves in texture
    - SIGNIFICANTLY harder
    - flexible
- 1 stroke = 1 triangle


## tentative progression plan:
1. font loading (utilize a libraty hopefully) and obtain bezier curves
2. single-character software rasterizer (write a png or something)
    - figure out AA here
3. single-character hardware rasterizer
4. application of transformations to single character (translation and scaling)
5. typesetting engine that parses "latex" into a scene graph
    - special symbols have hardcoded rules
    - use kerning data
6. typesetting of latex
7. typesetting of non-character bezier-curve based things (axes, tick marks, etc)

## simplifying assumptions:
- use latex font (include in repo, otf only, hardcoded path, cant go wrong) legal to redistribute

## rust-libraries
rustybuzz - text shaping. not sure if i need this if im gonna typeset math myself but anyway
